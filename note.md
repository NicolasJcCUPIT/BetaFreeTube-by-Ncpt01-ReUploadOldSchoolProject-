# beta school project
This project is a practical exam that I've made during school in a short amount of time.
Regardless of all the functionalities, this is just a beta.
The documentation is in French; other projects will include both English and French...
Enjoy, and don't hesitate to give me feedbacks!
I'll update more advanced and structured projects to show off my skills...
